# crestron-macOS

This is just me documenting how I manage and work within the crestron ecosystem while utilizing macOS. It is most often more beneficial for me to not have to run a VM just to hit baseline functions of toolbox, and I prefer to only open a VM if I plan to use SIMPL, VTPRO, etc.

# What to expect

Anytime someone asks about using macOS with crestron the answer is always "VM". I think the answer is broader than that and I hope to build a resource that helps show other ways to work with Crestron gear, without using the official tools :). My aim is to make this site a "go-to" resource by aggregating bits of details I was able to scour the internet for or research myself. (See Credits.)
