## Purpose
I've spent the better part of a decade learning how to operate within the crestron ecosystem, all within a windows world, as that was the only option. As I've continued learning, I've learned that sometimes the tools given to you may fail you and learning all of the underlying functions allows you to take matters into your own hands. This ended up with more and more time in the toolbox console. As I've switched to macOS, and typically utilize parallels to run the Crestron Suite, it becomes cumbersome to virtualize a machine just to open toolbox and system info! So I've taken the console commands I've learned and am working to be able to manage as much as possible from terminal using SSH and do as much work in macOS as possible. I'm putting it out there to help others, and allow others to pitch in things they've learned.
